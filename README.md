Analysis of PyCity SchoolsÂ¶
Analysis was conducted on 15 schools, of type district and charter, ranging in size from 427 to 4,976 students. Detailed analysis was conducted of math, reading and overall scores by school spending per capita, school size and school type.

## Findings
Spending per capita is not a good indicator of performance as data shows the larger the spending range the lower the percentage of students passing both math and reading.
School size is a good general indicator of performace as data shows schools with less than 2000 students tended to perform better (larger % of students passing math and reading) than larger schools with more than 2000 students.
School type is a good general indicator of performance as data shows charter schools significantly outperformed district schools. Howev
School type appears to be correlated to school size as most (all but one) charter schools are have less than 2000 students while all district schools have more than 2000 students.
